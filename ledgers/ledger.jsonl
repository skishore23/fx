Since the database lookup for \"smartphone_price\" returned no results, we need to find the price of the smartphone through another means.\n\nLet's assume we have a standard price for a smartphone. For example, if a smartphone costs $800, we can proceed with the calculation. However, if you have a specific model in mind, please provide the price.\n\nNext, we need to determine the sales tax rate in New York. The combined state and local sales tax rate in New York City is typically around 8.875%.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost using these assumptions:\n\n1. Price per smartphone: $800\n2. Quantity: 5 smartphones\n3. Sales tax rate: 8.875%\n\nTotal cost calculation:\n1. Subtotal (without tax) = Price per smartphone × Quantity = $800 × 5 = $4,000\n2. Total tax = Subtotal × Sales tax rate = $4,000 × 0.08875 = $355\n3. Total cost (including tax) = Subtotal + Total tax = $4,000 + $355 = $4,355\n\nTherefore, the total cost of ordering 5 smartphones for the New York office, including tax, is $4,355.\n\nIf you need the exact price of a specific smartphone model or a different tax rate, please provide that information, or let me know if you want to use a tool to find the current smartphone price."],"beforeHash":"1661d9faab390e6d5b7b3372e4c3ee0ebccdffc89b3ab6c30b6c063fca67f185","id":"349c7c93-4eb5-459f-9157-936dc86961e7","name":"setSolution","ts":"2025-05-08T05:49:06.181Z"}

In 2023, new frameworks are emerging that offer enhanced scalability and integration with cloud services, enabling more complex simulations and real-time decision-making.\n\n#### 1.2 Multi-Agent Systems\nThe development of multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks has gained momentum, with platforms like Ray and PettingZoo facilitating the creation of environments where multiple agents can interact. These frameworks support cooperative and competitive scenarios, making them ideal for applications in gaming, autonomous vehicles, and distributed systems.\n\n### 2. Integration with Natural Language Processing\n\nAI agent frameworks are increasingly integrating natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to enhance human-agent interaction. Frameworks like Rasa and Microsoft Bot Framework are leading this integration, providing tools for building conversational agents that can understand and respond to human language with greater accuracy.\n\n### 3. Open Source vs. Proprietary Frameworks\n\nThe debate between open-source and proprietary frameworks continues, with open-source options like TensorFlow Agents and PyMARL gaining popularity due to their flexibility and community support. Proprietary frameworks, on the other hand, often offer specialized features and dedicated support, appealing to enterprise users.\n\n### 4. Ethical and Responsible AI\n\nAs AI agents become more autonomous, ethical considerations are paramount. Frameworks are increasingly incorporating tools for bias detection, transparency, and accountability. Initiatives like IBM's AI Fairness 360 and Google's Model Card Toolkit are examples of efforts to ensure responsible AI development.\n\n## Significant Insights\n\n- **Scalability and Cloud Integration**: The ability to scale AI agent frameworks and integrate them with cloud services is a significant trend, enabling more complex and resource-intensive applications.\n- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: The rise of multi-agent frameworks highlights the importance of collaboration and competition in AI, with applications ranging from cooperative robotics to strategic games.\n- **NLP Integration**: The seamless integration of NLP capabilities into AI agent frameworks is enhancing the interactivity and usability of intelligent agents.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- **Data Privacy Concerns**: As AI agents become more integrated into everyday applications, concerns about data privacy and security remain a significant challenge.\n- **Standardization**: The lack of standardization across frameworks can lead to compatibility issues and hinder the development of interoperable systems.\n- **Ethical Implications**: Ensuring ethical AI development is an ongoing challenge, with frameworks needing to address issues of bias, fairness, and accountability.\n\n## Potential Applications\n\n- **Autonomous Vehicles**: AI agent frameworks can be used to develop sophisticated control systems for autonomous vehicles, enhancing safety and efficiency.\n- **Healthcare**: Intelligent agents can assist in diagnostics, patient monitoring, and personalized medicine, improving healthcare delivery.\n- **Smart Cities**: AI agents can optimize urban planning, traffic management, and resource allocation, contributing to the development of smart cities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe landscape of AI agent frameworks in 2023 is characterized by rapid advancements and increasing complexity. While significant progress has been made in scalability, multi-agent systems, and NLP integration, challenges remain in data privacy, standardization, and ethical AI. As these frameworks continue to evolve, they hold the potential to transform various industries, from transportation to healthcare, offering innovative solutions to complex problems."],"beforeHash":"empty","id":"09010483-7df5-4d85-87d8-b8085424f900","name":"set:finalReport","ts":"2025-05-08T20:11:35.090Z"}
