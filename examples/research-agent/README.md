3. **Node.js**: Version 20+

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
   ```env
   FIRECRAWL_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { runResearchAgent } from './research-agent';

// Run research on any topic - completely dynamic
const result = await runResearchAgent('Quantum Computing Applications', {
  depth: 'deep',
  maxSources: 10
});

console.log(`Report saved to: ${result.reportPath}`);
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Run research with default settings
npm start "Your Research Topic"

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Architecture

The research agent uses fx-core's Chain of Thought pattern:

### 1. Initialize Chain of Thought
- Sets up reasoning state with problem definition
- Initializes thoughts array and step counter

### 2. Execute Chain of Thought Pattern
- Uses `createChainOfThoughtPattern` from `fx-core/patterns.ts`
- Implements step-by-step reasoning process
- Generates thoughts and reasoning for each step

### 3. Process Tools Based on Reasoning
- Executes research tools based on Chain of Thought conclusions
- Uses AI-powered tool selection and parameter extraction
- No hardcoded tool parameters - everything is dynamic

### 4. Update Conversation
- Incorporates Chain of Thought results into conversation
- Maintains reasoning trail for transparency

## Research Process

The agent follows a sophisticated Chain of Thought research process:

### 1. Problem Analysis
- AI analyzes the research topic using Chain of Thought
- Breaks down complex topics into manageable components
- Identifies key research questions and approaches

### 2. Dynamic Source Discovery
- Uses AI-powered Google search for any topic
- Discovers relevant URLs through intelligent analysis
- No hardcoded source lists - everything is dynamic

### 3. Content Extraction
- Scrapes content from discovered sources using Firecrawl
- Extracts metadata and analyzes content quality
- Handles any URL format dynamically

### 4. AI-Powered Analysis
- Uses Chain of Thought for content analysis
- Generates insights, themes, and conclusions
- All analysis is AI-generated - no hardcoded templates

### 5. Report Generation
- Creates comprehensive reports using AI reasoning
- Adapts report structure to any research topic
- Generates professional-quality output

## Tools Available

- **`google_search`**: AI-powered search for any topic
- **`discover_urls`**: Dynamic URL discovery using AI reasoning
- **`scrape_url`**: Web scraping with Firecrawl integration
- **`crawl_website`**: Multi-page crawling capabilities
- **`analyze_content`**: AI-powered content analysis
- **`generate_report`**: Comprehensive report generation

## Example Output
