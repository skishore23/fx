# Contributing to Fx Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Fx Framework! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Git

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fx.git
   cd fx
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## 📝 Code Style

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use functional programming principles
- Follow immutable data patterns
- Use pure functions where possible

### Functional Programming Principles

- **Immutability**: Never mutate state in place
- **Pure Functions**: Functions should not have side effects
- **Composition**: Build complex operations from simple ones
- **Fail-Fast**: No fallbacks, explicit error propagation
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system

### Code Organization

- Keep files under 300 lines
- Use single responsibility principle
- Organize code in logical modules
- Use meaningful names for functions and variables

## 🧪 Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all public APIs
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📦 Package Structure

### @fx/core

The core framework package should:
- Provide functional programming primitives
- Implement category theory constructs
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow semantic versioning

### Adding New Features

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Implement the feature with tests
3. Update documentation
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request
