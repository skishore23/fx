# Building Effective Agents with the f(x) Functional Framework

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to building, testing, and debugging LLM-powered agents using the [f(x)](https://github.com/skishore23/fx) functional library. It draws on best practices from [Anthropic's research on building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) and demonstrates how to implement composable, transparent, and maintainable agentic systems.
